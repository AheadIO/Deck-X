This version of the Deck-X Project North Star headset does away with the threaded inserts found in other versions of the headset. The rationale for this is that while the inserts do reduce wear on the parts after repeated assembly and disassembly, not all North Star builders have a soldering iron on hand. Also, counterintuitively, the inserts can make parts fit together less precisely, as builders may install the inserts themselves with differing degrees of precision.
