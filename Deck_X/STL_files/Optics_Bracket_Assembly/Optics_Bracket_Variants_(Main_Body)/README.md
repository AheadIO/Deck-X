The two directories here contain two versions of the optics bracket each. You only need one of these four optics brackets for your headset build.

In one directory there are brackets that use heat-set threaded inserts that need to be installed into the brackets using a soldering iron or other appropriately heated appropriate tool. The inserts prolong the life of your headset parts if you're going to frequently remove the lid to change the arrangement of sensors, or if you plan on swapping out display trays to change the optical focal depth of the headset. In the other you will find brackets that do not require these inserts.

Each directory contains a bracket for use with the classic Leap Motion controller, and another for the Rigel sensor, now renamed the Ultraleap Stereo IR 170 Camera Module.
