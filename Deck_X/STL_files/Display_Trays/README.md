There are six total variations of the display trays; three each in versions either without heat-set threaded inserts. The three versions in each of these folders each gives the headset a different optical focal depth at the center of the combiners.

The 25cm trays are best-suited for software where the bulk of the visual content will be within arm's reach. These trays produce the brightest images and the widest field of view, but more distant objects suffer from a pronounced vergence / accomodation conflict that makes them seem a bit cartoonish.

The 75cm trays are best-suited for software where most of the visual content will be beyond arm's reach, or even at a distance of many meters. This optical arrangement loses several degrees of FoV on either side, and also results in noticeably a dimmer image. But the vergence / accomodation conflict for distant objects is rendered a non-issue.

The 50cm trays are a linear interpolation between the 25cm and 75cm arrangements, and were not part of Leap Motion's initial set of options. They do, however seem to sit in a sweet spot where they fill all of the field of view for most wearers of the headset, produce an acceptably bright image (bright white content is still very close to opaque when seen in an artificially lit room), and most importantly don't result in experience-breaking vergence / accomodation conflict for content at any distance for most users.

At Combine Reality, we're currently building all of our sample and evaluation headsets with the 50cm trays without inserts, but some people still have a preference for one of the others, and this project is all about flexibility.

(See the README in ../Optics_Bracket_Assembly/Optics_Bracket_Variants_(Main_Body) for an explanation of why you might or might not want to use the heat-set inserts.)
